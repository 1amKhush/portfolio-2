          <h2>The Problem with Traditional File Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever tried to share a large file with a friend? Maybe you
            uploaded it to Google Drive, waited forever, sent them the link, and
            then they had to download it from Google's servers. Or perhaps
            you've used services like WeTransfer, only to find your link expired
            after a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the thing: all these services have something in common—they
            rely on a <strong>central server</strong>. Your file goes up to
            someone else's computer, sits there, and then your friend downloads
            it down. You're essentially paying (with money, data, or ads) for
            the privilege of using someone else's storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if you could just send the file directly to your friend?
            Computer to computer. No middleman.
            <strong>That's exactly what Torrentium does.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>What is Peer-to-Peer, Anyway?</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine you're at a party and you want to share a photo with
            everyone. The traditional way would be to give your photo to the
            host, who then makes copies and hands them out to guests. If the
            host leaves, nobody gets the photo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peer-to-peer (P2P) is different. You show the photo to a few people
            near you, they take pictures of it with their phones, and now they
            can share it too. Even if you leave the party, the photo keeps
            spreading. There's no single person controlling everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >That's the magic of P2P—everyone is both a consumer and a
              provider.</strong
            >
            When you download a file, you also help share it with others.
          </p>

          <h2>Why I Built Torrentium</h2>
          <p>I wanted to create something that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Just works</strong> - Download one file, double-click, and
              you're sharing
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Doesn't need a server</strong> - No monthly hosting bills,
              no central point of failure
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Respects privacy</strong> - Your files go directly to your
              friend, not through my servers
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Actually looks nice</strong> - Because command-line tools
              scare most people
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result is <strong>Torrentium</strong>: a desktop app where you
            can share files by just dragging them in, and download files with a
            simple code (called a CID).
          </p>

          <h2>The Three Big Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Building a P2P system sounds simple until you actually try it. There
            are three major problems that kept me up at night:
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 1: How Do Computers Find Each Other?</h3>
          <p>
            When you type "google.com" in your browser, your computer asks a
            special server (called DNS) for Google's address. But in a P2P
            network, there's no central directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like trying to find someone at a massive festival with
            no phone signal. How do you find your friend?
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution is something called a
            <strong>Distributed Hash Table (DHT)</strong>. It works like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Everyone at the festival memorizes a small piece of information
              about where a few other people are
            </li>
            <li>
              When you're looking for someone, you ask the people around you
            </li>
            <li>
              They might not know, but they know someone who might know
              someone...
            </li>
            <li>
              Eventually, through a chain of "ask your neighbor," you find your
              friend
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In Torrentium, when you share a file, you tell a few nearby
            computers "Hey, I have this file!" They remember that. When someone
            else wants that file, they ask around until someone says "Oh yeah, I
            know who has that!"
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the same technology that powers IPFS and many other
            decentralized systems.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Challenge 2: The NAT Problem (or "Why Can't Computers Just
            Connect?")
          </h3>
          <p>
            Here's a frustrating reality: most computers can't directly talk to
            each other on the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine your home network as an apartment building. Your router is
            the front desk. When you visit a website, you tell the front desk "I
            want to talk to Google," and they facilitate that conversation. But
            if someone from outside wants to talk to you, the front desk says
            "Sorry, I don't know who you're asking for."
          </p>
          <p>
            This is called <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong>,
            and it's everywhere. Your home router does it. Your office network
            does it. Even your mobile carrier does it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how do two computers behind NATs talk to each other? We use a few
            tricks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>STUN Servers:</strong> These are like public phone booths.
              Both computers call the same public server, and the server tells
              each of them "Here's how the other person can reach you." It's
              like two people meeting at a landmark to exchange contact info.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hole Punching:</strong> Once we know each other's
              "addresses," we both try to connect at the same time. It's like
              two people knocking on each other's doors simultaneously—the doors
              stay open just long enough for the connection to work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relay Servers:</strong> When all else fails, we use a
              relay. It's like asking a mutual friend to pass messages between
              you. Not as fast as direct communication, but it always works.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Torrentium automatically tries all these methods. You don't have to
            think about it—it just connects.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge 3: Making Sure Files Aren't Corrupted</h3>
          <p>
            When you download a file piece by piece from multiple strangers on
            the internet, how do you know you're getting the real file? What if
            someone sends you garbage data, either by accident or on purpose?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where <strong>content-addressable storage</strong> comes in.
            It's a fancy term for a simple idea:
          </p>
          <blockquote>The name of a file is based on its contents.</blockquote>
          <p>
            When you share a file in Torrentium, we calculate a unique
            "fingerprint" (called a hash) of that file. This fingerprint becomes
            the file's address—its <strong>CID (Content Identifier)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Here's why this is brilliant:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If even one tiny bit of the file is different, the fingerprint is
              completely different
            </li>
            <li>
              When you download a file, you can calculate its fingerprint and
              compare
            </li>
            <li>
              If they match, you know you have the exact same file—it's
              mathematically certain
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is the same principle that cryptocurrencies use to verify
            transactions. It's also how IPFS names all its files.
          </p>

          <h2>How Torrentium Actually Works</h2>
          <p>
            Let me walk you through what happens when you share and download a
            file:
          </p>

          <h3>Sharing a File</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>You drag a file into Torrentium</li>
            <li>The app calculates the file's fingerprint (CID)</li>
            <li>It chops the file into small pieces (1 MB each)</li>
            <li>Each piece gets its own fingerprint too</li>
            <li>Torrentium announces to the network: "I have this CID!"</li>
            <li>You get a code to share with your friend</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            That's it. Your file never leaves your computer until someone
            requests it.
          </p>

          <h3>Downloading a File</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Your friend gives you a CID</li>
            <li>You paste it into Torrentium</li>
            <li>The app asks the network: "Who has this?"</li>
            <li>It finds people who have pieces of the file</li>
            <li>It downloads pieces from multiple people simultaneously</li>
            <li>Each piece is verified with its fingerprint</li>
            <li>Pieces are assembled into the complete file</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The cool part? If the download is interrupted, Torrentium remembers
            which pieces you already have. You can resume right where you left
            off.
          </p>

          <h2>The Technology Stack</h2>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I Learned Building This</h2>

          <h3>1. Networking is Hard</h3>
          <p>
            Getting two computers to reliably communicate across the internet is
            way harder than it should be. NATs, firewalls, ISPs that block
            certain traffic—there are so many things that can go wrong. The only
            solution is to try multiple methods and have lots of fallbacks.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Distributed Systems Are a Different Beast</h3>
          <p>
            When there's no central server, you can't just "fix a bug on the
            server." If something goes wrong, every copy of the app has the bug.
            You have to think very carefully about backwards compatibility and
            graceful degradation.
          </p>

          <h3>3. User Experience Matters More Than Fancy Features</h3>
          <p>
            I could add a hundred advanced features, but if a regular person
            can't figure out how to share their first file in 30 seconds, none
            of it matters. I spent more time on the "just drag and drop"
            experience than on most technical features.
          </p>

          <h2>What's Next?</h2>
          <p>Torrentium is already working, but there's more I want to add:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile apps</strong> - Share files from your phone</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Encrypted sharing</strong> - Password-protect sensitive
              files
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automatic updates</strong> - No more manual downloads
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Selective downloads</strong> - Download just one file from
              a folder
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to try Torrentium, it's just a single executable file.
            Download it, run it, and start sharing. No installation, no account
            creation, no servers to configure.
          </p>
          <p>
            And because it's open source, you can look at every line of code and
            even contribute improvements.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Building Torrentium taught me that the internet doesn't have to work
            the way we've accepted. We don't need giant corporations to store
            our files or facilitate our communications. The technology for true
            peer-to-peer computing exists—it just needs to be made accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Every file you share directly with a friend is a small act of
              digital independence.</strong
            >
            And that feels pretty good.
          </p>
